# IoTrains

Internet of Trains :)


The existing systems in the market are either with old roots (DCC) or not opensource (MÃ¤rklin). More then that they were built over 20 years ago and therefore have historical restrictions. In order to be able more flexible I started to write a firmware for the trains and accessories using ESP32/ESP8266.

The projects consists of:
 - [Firmware](./firmware/) which is written in c++ using PlatformIO,
 - MQTT Broker, see [emqx](./emqx) as an example,
 - A [backend](./webui/server) written in typesript,
 - as well [frontend](./webui/client/) in react,
 - [json schema](./jsonschema/) describes a mqtt based protocol.

# Notes
 - Connect an audio amplifier to an i2s capable pin i.e. DAC_1.

## TODO
 - docker for backend
 - responsive ui / refresh on update
 - process rfid events
 - sqlite3
 - schematic
